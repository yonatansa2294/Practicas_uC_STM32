# Practical_uC_STM32
Final project

Program used for RMS current measurement using FIR type SAL and CAL digital filters.
The user receives the current value through a serial terminal, each time he presses the user button on the board.

Software modules were developed for ADC, Timer, UART and additional specific modules for RMS current measurement, implementation of software debouncing and non-blocking delays.

Board used: STM32F411CEU6 Black Pill
